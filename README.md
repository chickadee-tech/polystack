### Setup ###
Components and footprints for PCB parts are not included in this repository. Instead, checkout the [chickadee-tech/kicad-libs](https://github.com/chickadee-tech/kicad-libs) repository in the same directory that your design folders live in. All part definitions should be relative so that they will load correctly.

### Pull requests ###
For fixes please submit a pull request to the original repository. After the pull request is merged, check the [Chickadee Tech Active Contributor Discount (ACD)](https://chickadee.tech/active-contributor) to see if you are eligible for a discount code to use on your next purchase.

### Derivatives ###
When developing your own Polystack boards DO NOT use Chickadee Tech trademarks and follow the [MIT license](LICENSE). While not required, please consider open sourcing your designs so others can learn from them. If you do email support@chickadee.tech and we may choose to add your project to the ACD.

You may license the Polystack logo for free by emailing support@chickadee.tech. We'll ask for your gerbers to ensure the design complies with specifications laid out [here](https://github.com/chickadee-tech/polystack/wiki) and provide written permission to use the trademark after compliance has been demonstrated.
